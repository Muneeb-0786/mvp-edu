# Using the Gemeni AI Model

This project includes a backend powered by a Gemeni AI model. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Install dependencies**: Ensure that you have the required Python packages or node modules that interact with the Gemeni API.
2. **Configure credentials**: Store your Gemeni API key in an environment variable named `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
3. **Connect to Postgres**: Use your preferred Postgres client or ORM to connect to your database, storing credentials in environment variables.
4. **Invoke the model**: Call the Gemeni API from your backend code, passing user input and handling the AI-generated responses.
5. **Persist data**: Save any relevant data from the Gemeni AI responses to your Postgres tables for later retrieval.

These guidelines should help you integrate the Gemeni model with your backend and database.
